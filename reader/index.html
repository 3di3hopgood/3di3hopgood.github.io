 <p>Online platforms are defined by "radical behaviourism": "they don't care about why their users engage with them, how engagement is generated, or what engagement even means - the only thing that matters is increasing their measures of clicking, viewing, scrolling" (Venturini, 2019).</p>

    In the saturated cyberscape of post-truth politics, social media platforms use blue verification marks to help users discriminate between 'true' and 'fake'. However, like all binary rating systems, verification cannot explicitly delineate these terms within its own self-referential logic.

    Blue ticks are reframed as an information processing device whose function is to encode and decode signals. It focuses on the inputs — the user interactions — that power this circuit, revealing how engagement rates determine who or what is considered 'true'.

   Since 2017, social media became more explicit that there is something else at stake beyond authenticity - calling it ‘notability’ or 'prominence' - a qualitative status determined through an internal process that is still opaque. Such hazy terms do not clarify what is being quantified and coded into the blue tick and the implications desired for it by the platform.

      Polarisation only arises when 'true' and 'false' become enclosed in a single circuit, creating artificial opposition -- 'true' as what is 'not false', and vice versa. The relational nature of these polarities results in practical paradoxes, as exemplified by Facebook failing to delete fake propaganda accounts despite its repeated promises to battle against false news.

    There is an actual criminological rationale tied currently to the verification systems with the new battle against fake news. Called 'rational choice theory', it states that 'when hiding behind an alias on social media platforms, people have a lower need for self-control and feel less responsible for the consequences of their actions' (Omernick and Sood 2013).

    Social media have been gradually piling up notions of truth, without necessarily clarifying any of them: already obscure truth as 'prominence' is now combined with the even more perplexing truth of cyberwar, fueled by the fake news scandals.
